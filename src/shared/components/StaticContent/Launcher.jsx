          be held in Wyoming, USA, administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with
          International Dispute Resolution Rules. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on the parties and

          bring suit in any court of law to enjoin infringement or other misuses of TRACK’s intellectual property
