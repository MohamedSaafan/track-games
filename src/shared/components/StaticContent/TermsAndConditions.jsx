      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          TRACK is a decentralized distributed application on a blockchain network, using smart contracts (each a “Smart
          Contract”) to enable its Users to own, buy, sell, transfer, and share unique digital rewards that can be
          visualized on the TRACK site through the TRACK App.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.1 TRACK Game Node. </span>
        <span>
          TRACK Game Node is a computer software and hardware system connected to TRACK. The TRACK Game Node supports
          blockchain video games by maintaining the cryptography and confirming transactions on the TRACK Blockchain
          through the TRACK App. Used herein, “TRACK Game Node” may represent either the node itself of a license the
          User obtains to run said node. &nbsp;The TRACK Game Nodes when combined form the “TRACK Game Node Network”.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.2 TRACK Blockchain. </span>
        <span>
          The TRACK Blockchain allows each User to store items, characters, digital rewards, and other attributes on the
          TRACK Blockchain public ledger that allows for decentralized, immutable record of ownership. Each User owns
          the non-fungible token (an “NFT”) for any of the in-game items on the TRACK Blockchain. When a User purchases,
          earns, or receives any NFT or digital reward the Smart Contract process, the User owns completely and outright
          the NFT and/or digital reward.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.3 TRACK Reward. </span>
        <span>
          Each User of any game on the TRACK Blockchain or the Site or any game contained on the Site or associated
          websites, and associated TRACK Game Node, may be able to earn or receive the TRACK Reward. The “TRACK Reward”
          consists of a representation of TRACK token, or other game tokens and NFTs, reflected on the TRACK Blockchain
          and/or TRACK App and the Site, which may or may not be bridged to other blockchains (including but not limited
          to Ethereum) through a minting process solely at the option and action of the User. &nbsp;When referencing the
          NFTs on the platform themselves in the singular and not specifically as a part of the TRACK Reward, same shall
          be referred to herein as “Platform Asset.” The TRACK Reward is a digital reward and not a Security Token.
          &nbsp;The TRACK Reward is not being offered to investors and there is no Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to
          promote the TRACK Reward. Like BTC (which is the digital reward generated from the Bitcoin blockchain), the
          TRACK reward is created through a unique blockchain protocol. Each User that participates in the TRACK
          Blockchain protocol shall receive 100% of the User’s allocated TRACK Reward and any other digital reward or
          NFT, which is deposited in the User’s TRACK App. The TRACK Reward, any NFT, and any other digital reward may
          reside solely within the TRACK Blockchain, and may or may not have value. &nbsp;TRACK cannot, and does not,
          control whether any of the TRACK Reward, any NFT, and any other digital reward has monetary value on any other
          blockchain. &nbsp;On the TRACK Blockchain, the Site, or any associated website, neither the TRACK Reward nor
          NFT nor other digital reward may be exchanged for currency.

      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.5.1.</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;TRACK will provide each User with a TRACK App. TRACK will never take custody or control over any NFT or
          digital reward stored in a User’s TRACK App. The TRACK App does not store, send or receive any NFT or reward,
          but such transactions occur directly on the TRACK Blockchain or other supported blockchains. Instead of the
          TRACK App, the User may use any compatible digital app or wallet provided by a third party company that safely
          connects to the TRACK Blockchain. A User may be able to use the TRACK App or other compatible wallet to send
          and receive any NFT or digital reward with other users of the TRACK Blockchain. TRACK does not offer any User
          the ability to exchange one form of currency for any other form of currency (fiat or digital). TRACK App is
          not a custodian, exchange or money transmitter.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.5.2.</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;When a User creates a TRACK App, the TRACK Blockchain software generates a cryptographic private key and
          public key pair that the User must use to send and receive any NFT or digital reward supported on the TRACK
          Blockchain. The User is solely responsible for storing, outside of TRACK’s Services, a backup of any User’s
          TRACK App, private key(s), or transaction information that the User maintains in the TRACK App or otherwise
          with the TRACK Services. If the User does not backup the TRACK App, the User may not be able to access the
          TRACK in the event that TRACK discontinues some or all of the TRACK Services.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.5.3.</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;In order for a transaction to be validated on the TRACK Blockchain, any TRACK transaction through the
          TRACK App must be confirmed and recorded in the distributed ledger associated with the TRACK Blockchain. The
          TRACK Blockchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network supported by the users of the TRACK Blockchain,
          which is not owned, controlled or operated by TRACK.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.5.4. </span>
        <span>
          TRACK has no control over any NFT or digital reward (including the TRACK Reward) generated through the TRACK
          Blockchain or the TRACK App or Site, and cannot ensure that any transaction details a User submits via the
          TRACK Services and TRACK App or Site will be confirmed or processed on the TRACK Blockchain. The User agrees
          and understands that the transaction details submitted by the User via the TRACK Services and TRACK App may
          not be completed or may be delayed by the TRACK Blockchain or any supporting blockchain used to process the
          transaction. TRACK does not guarantee that the TRACK App can transfer title or right in any NFT or digital
          reward, and TRACK makes no warranties of title of any kind. Once transaction details have been submitted to
          the TRACK Blockchain, TRACK cannot assist the User to cancel or otherwise modify such transaction or details.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.5.5. </span>
        <span>
          In the event of a fork of the TRACK Blockchain or any other supported blockchain, TRACK may not be able to
          support the User’s activity related to TRACK or any other supported NFT or reward. The User agrees and
          understands that in the event of a fork of the TRACK Blockchain, any transaction associated with the TRACK App
          or TRACK Services may not be completed, may be partially completed, incorrectly completed, or substantially
          delayed. TRACK is not responsible for any loss incurred by any User caused in whole or in part, directly or
          indirectly, by a fork of the TRACK Blockchain.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.5.6. </span>
        <span>
          With respect to the TRACK App, TRACK does not receive or store a User’s TRACK App password, or any keys,
          network addresses or transaction history. TRACK cannot assist any User with TRACK App password retrieval. The
          User is solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret the User’s TRACK App PIN (password),
          keys and address. Any NFT or digital reward a User has stored within its TRACK App may become inaccessible if
          the User does not know or keep secret its TRACK App keys and PIN. Any third party with knowledge of one or
          more of a User’s credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, App identifier, PIN, or keys)
          can dispose of the NFT or digital rewards in the User’s TRACK App.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">1.5.7. </span>
        <span>
          TRACK does not currently charge a fee for the TRACK App, receiving, sending, or storing TRACK. However, TRACK
          reserves the right to do so in the future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to the
          User incurring such fee. Notwithstanding, the TRACK Blockchain may have Blockchain Transaction Fees required
          to transact NFT or digital reward transactions through the TRACK Blockchain. TRACK may attempt to calculate
          for the User any Blockchain Transactions Fees, though such calculation may be inaccurate or excessive. The
          User may select a greater or lesser fee, and the User is solely responsible for paying any Blockchain
          Transaction Fees required on the TRACK Blockchain. TRACK will neither advance nor fund any Blockchain
          Transaction Fee on any User’s behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.

        <span className="fw-bold">1.5.8. </span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;From time to time, there may be programs in place to allow User to receive a reward, in the form of
          Track Reward, NFT, or otherwise, based on actions taken by the User, whether it be by referral or other
          program in place at the time (“Additional Rewards”). &nbsp;User understands that TRACK makes no
          representations or warrants regarding the Additional Rewards. &nbsp;Notwithstanding or limiting the foregoing,
          TRACK further makes no representations or warrants surrounding the operation of any TRACK Services or that
          said TRACK Services/Additional Rewards will be error-free or uninterrupted. &nbsp;User accepts the sole
          responsibility for taking any and all actions to obtain any Additional Rewards, and holds TRACK harmless for
          any opportunity cost or losses that occur as a result of the non-receipt of anticipated Additional Rewards,
          monetary or otherwise.

      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">8.1 Notification.</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;TRACK notifies each User of certain disclosures and risks associated with blockchain NFT and digital
          rewards and their associated technology and protocols. TRACK Services are not an investment product, and no
          action, notice, communication by any means, or omission by TRACK shall be understood or interpreted as such.
          TRACK has no influence whatsoever on the TRACK Blockchain, the transactions and consensus protocols, or the
          NFTs or digital rewards, including the TRACK Reward. Ownership of a TRACK App or Game Node or the use of TRACK
          Services does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security, debt or equivalent
          right, or any right to receive any future revenue or form of participation in or relating to any blockchain or
          digital reward, including the TRACK Blockchain or TRACK Reward.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">8.2 Digital Rewards.</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;Digital rewards are not considered legal tender, are not issued or backed by any government, and have
          fewer regulatory protections than traditional currency. Moreover, digital rewards are not insured against
          theft or loss by any insurance corporation or any investor protection, including the Federal Deposit Insurance
          Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">8.3 Market Risk. </span>
        <span>
          The value of NFTs and digital rewards are derived from supply and demand in the global marketplace, which can
          rise or fall independent of any government currency. Holding NFTs and digital rewards carries exchange rate
          and other types of risk. The value of NFTs and digital rewards may be derived from the continued willingness
          of market participants to exchange traditional government currency for digital rewards, which may result in
          the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular digital reward should the market
          disappear. The volatility and unpredictability of the price and value of NFTs and digital rewards, relative to
          government currency, may result in significant loss over a short period of time. TRACK cannot guarantee or
          warrant the value of any NFT, digital reward or blockchain, including the TRACK Blockchain and TRACK Reward,
          and explicitly warns the User that that there is no reason to believe that any NFT or blockchain reward will
          increase in value, and that they may hold no value, decrease in value, or entirely lose value.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">8.4. Regulatory Risk.</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may
          adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual NFTs and blockchain rewards. &nbsp;The
          regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in
          many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such
          technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes
          to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain
          technology and its applications. &nbsp;Such changes could negatively impact the TRACK Services in various
          ways, including, for example, through a determination that any of the above are regulated financial
          instruments that require registration. TRACK may cease any distribution of any of the above, the development
          of the TRACK Games platform or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make
          it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so. &nbsp;The industry in which TRACK operates is
          new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions.
          There can be no assurance that governmental, quasi-governmental, regulatory or other similar types of
          (including banking) authorities will not examine the operations of TRACK and/or pursue enforcement actions
          against TRACK. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting TRACK in particular. All
          of this may subject TRACK to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause TRACK to restructure its
          operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm TRACK’s
          reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the TRACK
          Services.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="fw-bold">8.5 Technology Risk.</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;Virtual NFT and digital reward transactions may be irreversible and losses due to fraudulent or
          accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some virtual transactions are deemed to be made when recorded
          on a public ledger, which may not necessarily be the date or time the user initiated the transaction. The
          nature of such virtual transactions may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attacks.

        <span className="fw-bold">8.6 Changes to TRACK Game Node Network. &nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          TRACK and User recognize that from time to time amendments will be made to the TRACK Game Node Network.
          &nbsp;TRACK and User both specifically agree that TRACK will, from time to time, present the TRACK Game Node
          Network with proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments'') that the Node Network will then vote on whether
          to implement or not (the “Governance Vote”). &nbsp;The User understands that the Proposed Amendments will be
          made at the discretion of TRACK, and TRACK owes the User no duty or obligation to make proposals in its best
          interests.
        </span>
        <span className="fw-bold">&nbsp; </span>
        <span>
          The User specifically understands that there may come a time when TRACK proposes an amendment that is not in
          or in direct opposition to the User’s best interests, financial or otherwise (including, but not limited to a
          change in the distribution calculation), and the User has no legal recourse against TRACK should any Proposed
          Amendment be approved and implemented through the Governance Vote. &nbsp;The User’s only recourse is to vote
          against said Proposed Amendment. &nbsp;TRACK and the User both agree that one such Proposed Amendment may be
          to change the specifications, including, but not limited to the internet connection, Random Access Memory,
          Central Processing Unit requirements, extra space, and any other requirements needed to run the Nodes (the
          “Specifications”). &nbsp;TRACK and User further agree that while the Specifications may be minimal on the
          effective date of this Agreement, this is subject to change through the Proposed Amendment and the Governance
          Vote. &nbsp;While TRACK does represent and covenant that the TRACK Game Node will always be able to be run
          using the current specifications, TRACK does not and cannot represent or covenant that any rewards earned
          (financial or otherwise) for doing so are not subject to change. &nbsp;

          resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator to be held in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA administered by the
          International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with International Dispute Resolution Rules. The

          jurisdiction. The prevailing party shall be entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees for the
          arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing TRACK and the User agree that TRACK may bring suit in any court of
          law to enjoin infringement or other misuse of TRACK’s intellectual property rights. Any disputes that may
          arise beyond the scope of the arbitration provision shall be exclusively subject to the State or Federal
          Courts located in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The User and TRACK consent to personal jurisdiction in those
          courts. CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S
